# fractol
Fract'ol is a project utilizing the 42 made miniLibX graphics library with the goal of recreating fractals using complex numbers. I implemented multi-threading, and dynamic coloring for this project.Â 

If you wish to run this project clone the repisitory, unzip the minilibx_macros and run the command 'make' to compile the files. Once done run the fractol executable file with an argument of 1 through 3 for the respective fractal. './fractol 1'

Here is what each of the following fractals look like:
